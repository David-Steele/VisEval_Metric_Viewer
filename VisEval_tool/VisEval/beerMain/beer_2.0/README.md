BEER 2.0
==========

BEER 2.0 is a trained machine translation evaluation metric with high correlation with human judgment both on sentence and corpus level. For the papers that describe BEER in more detail look at the [References section](https://github.com/stanojevic/beer#references) on this page.

This pages is about the newest version of BEER which is 2.0. If you want to use old version which has some features not present in the new version (paraphrasing, reordering only evaluation, syntactic features...) then look at the branch for [BEER 1.1](https://github.com/stanojevic/beer/tree/BEER_1.1)


#Installation

BEER 2.0 includes all its dependencies in the tar.gz. Basic installation commands on a standard Unix terminal could be as follows:

    wget https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.stanojevic/beer/beer_2.0.tar.gz
    tar xfvz beer_2.0.tar.gz

After these commands the directory `beer_2.0` will contain all the necessary files.

#Usage

In the installation directory there will be a shell script `beer` that should be used for evaluation. Its usage is straightforward:

    $BEER_HOME/beer -s system_translations.en -r reference_translations.en

That command will print only the corpus level score. If sentence level score is needed then additional parameter `--printSentScores` will print them out.

If you want to tune the Moses system with BEER you need to compile Moses with adding the files from `src_moses` directory.
